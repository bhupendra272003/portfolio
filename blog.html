                    <h2>HTML</h2>
                    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As
                        the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions. So what is HTML? HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which
                        you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. </p>

                    <h2>Java Script</h2>
                    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a cross-platform, object-oriented programming language used by developers to make web pages interactive. It allows developers to create dynamically updating content, use animations, pop-up menus, clickable buttons,
                        control multimedia, etc. The use of JavaScript can be both on the client-side and server-side. While HTML and CSS languages are used to give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript is used to add interactive elements that
                        engage users. Without JavaScript, 90% of Internet webpages would be static. </p>

                    <h2>Database</h2>
                    <p>Database defined A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the
                        data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database. Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically
                        modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query
                        language (SQL) for writing and querying data.</p>
